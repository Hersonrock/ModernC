On this project I'll need to make two sorting algorithm programs. Which should
sort a set of randomly generated numbers and output to file.
I will also need to create a program that checks the resulting file.

Requirements:

1) There must be a makefile
2) Sorting algorithms must have their own .c file.
3) There a separate .c file for the test program.
4) There must be a separate .c file for read and write to file.
5) There must be a random number generator as well, I will be using /dev/urandom
6) I must specify a LIMITS constant on a header file, so I can control how 
many numbers I will be generating and sorting.
7) there must be a time output so I can compare how much time it took to execute
the programs. Similar to the /usr/bin/time function.
8) The sorting functions will just take an array of doubles and output a
sorted array.

I'll start with making the write to file function. The requirement is simple,
it will take an array[n] of doubles and write them to a file in csv format.
