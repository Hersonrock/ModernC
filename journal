Today I read up to page 49, the next step is a challenge where I will do sorting

I don't recall when was the first time I did a sort algorithm it will be fun.

Completed the first step in the challenge 1, created the project directory 
structure, header files, makefile and a journal with requisites and next steps

I'll continue tomorrow

Continuing work on Challenge 1, is going well! I had some problems with the 
strtod() function, but nothing that some GDB did not help with.

I swear I updated my journal for the past days but seems it did not save.. a 
shame

over these last days I completed the algorthms for quick and merge sort.
I'm only pending a time function. 

I struggled a lot with quick sort, I need to learn more about it.
