Today I read up to page 49, the next step is a challenge where I will do sorting

I don't recall when was the first time I did a sort algorithm it will be fun.

Completed the first step in the challenge 1, created the project directory 
structure, header files, makefile and a journal with requisites and next steps

I'll continue tomorrow

Continuing work on Challenge 1, is going well! I had some problems with the 
strtod() function, but nothing that some GDB did not help with.

I swear I updated my journal for the past days but seems it did not save.. a 
shame

over these last days I completed the algorthms for quick and merge sort.
I'm only pending a time function. 

I struggled a lot with quick sort, I need to learn more about it.

Today I implemented the time function but is not working. Its not giving me any
time difference between start and end of the function.
I have downloaded https://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/gnu/time/time-1.9.tar.gz
to try and read how /usr/bin/time was implemented but no luck so far on 
understanding it.

I'll keep working on it tomorrow

Finished this challenge! I completed all requirements.
Found out that given the kind of data I'm using quick sort is faster
This was a really nice project and I'm sure I can improve it a lot.

I'm sure will look at it in a few months for now and see a lot of things that 
I've could have done better, thats the goal.
